I am a PhD student in Physics in the *Observational Cosmology* group at [IFAE](https://www.ifae.es/groups/cosmology/) in Barcelona. I am interested in extracting insights from extensive galaxy survey data to deepen our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe. To achieve this, I develop innovative statistical methods and software solutions for data analysis.

My background includes professional and research experience in 3D printing. I am passionate about computer science, and I thoroughly enjoy problem-solving in general.
